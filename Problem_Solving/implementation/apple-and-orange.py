def count_falling_in_range(tree_pos, fruits, s, t):
    """
    Count how many fruits fall within the house range.

    Parameters:
    tree_pos (int): The position of the tree on the xâ€‘axis.
    fruits (Iterable[int]): Distances each fruit falls from tree_pos.
    s (int): Start point of Sam's house.
    t (int): End point of Sam's house (inclusive).

    Returns:
    int: Number of fruits that land on the house (i.e., between s and t).
    """
    # For each distance d in fruits, compute absolute position (tree_pos + d)
    # and count it if it lies within the inclusive range [s, t].

def countApplesAndOranges(s, t, a, b, apples, oranges):
    """
    Calculate and print the number of apples and oranges that land on Sam's house.

    Parameters:
    s (int): Start point of Sam's house.
    t (int): End point of Sam's house (inclusive).
    a (int): Position of the apple tree.
    b (int): Position of the orange tree.
    apples (Iterable[int]): Distances each apple falls from the apple tree.
    oranges (Iterable[int]): Distances each orange falls from the orange tree.

    Side Effects:
    Prints two lines:
      1) Number of apples that land on the house.
      2) Number of oranges that land on the house.
